Todd Hume,2,2020-06-18 17:15:54,"I have a strong love/hate relationship with Jobber. My company has been a customer of Jobber’s since 2016. We are medium sized commercial cleaning employing about 40 staff. Some elements of their service meet our requirements very well and other elements are very weak, which has caused significant financial loss. Our primary use of Jobber is for scheduling of and the communication of shifts via the app. The scheduling side of this is top notch. Its powerful and easy to use. Job creation and manipulation is pretty much bang on. And the communication of these schedules through to individuals via the phone app is fantastic. However being individual focused rather than team focused it can get a bit cumbersome to navigate high job loading, even when employing their filters. As such we choose only to run a part of our business off this app. The phone based app itself is great. Its an incredibly valuable tool for management and cleaners alike. For us one of the biggest downfalls of Jobber is the timesheet functionality. Time tracking meshes in directly to the scheduling and job tracking and we have to use it. Unfortunately the Timesheets are fundamentally flawed. The app does not require the user to have the phone's GPS location enabled in order them to log in or out. The means that timesheet entries can be created without gps location tags. So essentially an employee can leave a job and then some time later log out while “forgetting” to turn on gps, thereby claiming time they did not work. And given that Jobber’s timesheet reports do not flag these locationless entries you are not made aware of the problem unless you specifically and manually go looking through the individual entries. This has caused us no end of trouble through the years. In fact just this week I have had to fire an employee because they were using this flaw to knowingly falsifying their timesheets and steal from my company. Which is why I now write this review. Its disappointing to see but numerous employees have tried to exploit this loop hole, at significant expense to my company. But perhaps most disappointing of all has been Jobber’s response to my concern that we were financially suffering from this flaw. When I first raised the issue with customer support I did not get an apology or really even an acknowledgement of my concern. Their response was “Hi, I'm not sure if in the future we will build a feature that only allows team members to clock in and out when their GPS services are turned on, but I can certainly share that feedback with our team.” That was it. This was 2 months ago. I have not heard back. Nothing has changed. The impression I have is that Jobber has an incredibly compassionless customer service. I really don’t feel that they care in the slightest about their role in the success of my business. And I have had multiple examples of this lack of care through the years. The most extreme example was their response when I highlighted discovering the fact that Jobber's standard settings for a basic Worker (found at the bottom of a hidden “Advanced Settings” menu) gave workers permission to edit their own timesheet entries. When I pointed out that employees were using this permission that Jobber granted them to falsify their timesheets and steal from the company their response was: “I apologize for your frustration here, I can totally understand why this would upset you."" And then later, after further requesting for them to respond: ""I would be happy to bring this feedback forward to our team to review, again I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you and your company.” That was it. What an Insult! 2 months later they issued an update that changed these standard permissions so that it was standard that Workers timesheets were uneditable. I’d like to be able to use Jobber’s Customer Portal but its got a long way to go before I would feel it can offer anything of value to my clients. Specifically it requires clarity and flexibility.",1,e2d19958-108b-4609-b455-f257ebb199d4,"Thanks for this thorough review, Todd.

A Google user,1,2019-05-28 21:13:46,"Joist will be losing tons of users who are processing millions of $$ through their app. I should have switched to using the invoicing service that I am already paying for in my Intuit quickbooks accounting subscription.  Undoubtedly, many other users have access to the same software.   The Intuit Invoicing charges the same amount to process payments and takes just as long to receive them into our banks. I will say that due to their in-depth ability to be customized and the risk/reward of using my time to actually create a customized invoice Joist has be the cheaper option.  In a nutshell, I will be extracting all of my client info and invoices from the Joist system, spending a couple of hours to create a even better estimate and invoicing system, and saving $120/year. Joist will lose much more than that.   I simply cannot justify paying for something twice and using the second product when the first is far superior and captures all of my accounting in one place.  Unless by some chance this ""Pro"" feature is done away with tonight I will no longer be using Joist.

They actually did a decent job on the app, however..where they really fall short, and I mean way short, is in the customer service department. They sell a credit card reader for $65.00, and say its a 7-10 day delivery. On about October 4th 2018, I decided to purchase one, paid the money, waited 7-10 days, it didn't arrive. I decided to write support, they told me they'd look into it. Nothing was done. Wrote again, nothing done. Requested a refund, I was ignored, requested a new reader, nothing done. They simply responded by saying that they confirmed with the carrier that it was delivered. However, I asked the carrier, and the carrier told me it was not delivered. I have spent well over 10 hours of my time trying to get a refund or for an item that this company sold me but never delivered. Everytime I ask about a refund they send me the same response, saying that they have deliverey confirmation on there end. Really? Do you think I have nothing better to do than keep writing support for a credit card reader? They won't offer a refund, or to send out a new reader. They are simply unconcerned. After going through this, I have decided to let everyone know that if you decide to do business with these people, they will not care about you when something like this happens to you. This is not the type of company that cares about it's customers. They have no concern about you or your time, or your money. For what it's worth.

A Google user,1,2018-09-20 20:26:21,My name is Shane. I am a residential contractor. Desired I would try the credit card feature that way my customers could pay by credit card. One of my customers sent a payment and joist needed verification of my identity after that was confirmed then they ask for my tax ID number LLC documents how much I made per year. Before they would release my funds to my bank account. After not only having to only be able to text them in a chat room. If you call they do not speak to you on the phone they only have the option of texting. Plus I sent them my social security number and that was very sketchy for me. Long story short I had to refund my customer's money back to him and it will take 7-10 business days to hit his account when it took only 10 seconds from when he paid for Joist to take it out of his bank account and sent him a receipt. The while time they never would transfer my money to my account. Very disappointed I have had over 30 of my contractor buddy's start using joist.

A Google user,3,2018-05-21 10:39:11,"I really do enjoy this app for the most part, mainly the invoices. But 
here's my rant. The estimates portion of this app is kind of garbage. I 
tried writing up a proposal for a remodel so I have to do it in the notes 
section which is at the bottom portion of the document. So the first thing 
my client sees when I email this estimate out is a blank page that has 
subtotal and total of $0. But they have to keep scrolling down in order to 
see my actual written proposal. As professionals never use line items as 
you would in a t&m job to write out our proposals. The estimates portion 
really needs to just be a written document not something where you have 
line items and you detailing everything by the part or the time you're 
putting into it. That's what we would call a T & M job, not a 
quoted/proposal job. The way your estimate portion of this app is set up I 
am able to accomplish the same thing in the invoice section. I can add a 
description in invoices, I can add line items in invoices tab. Everything 
that's in the estimates is already in the invoicing. Why couldn't a guy 
write up everything he was going to use including his time in the invoicing 
section and show the customer what the total would be in essence showing 
them an estimate, you know for the service work end of things. Just all 
seems kind of redundant. Please change the estimates into a more of a 
written documentation form of sending to our clients along with the same 
features of them signing the document along with all the other options of 
sending and receiving feedback. At this point I can only use this app for 
my service work AKA T&M work. I will have to either use my email or a 
different app for my proposals",3,e36555b1-3056-4ab7-b94f-009b1852b0db,"Hi Ben, thanks for taking the time to explain how you think we can improve the app. I think you raised a lot of good points here and we'll take everything you suggested under advisement.

If you do a lot of work for the same company, for example, a property management company, you can't tell your estimates apart. If you have more than one estimate or invoice for a client, there is nothing on the home page to distinguish the different work. They have an option to show a PO# but they don't show the PO# in the summary where all your estimates and invoices are listed. So basically, if you have 10 invoices for the same customer, you have to click on each one to figure out which one belongs to which job.

A Google user,3,2014-05-08 01:35:12,It's simple but missing features. Looks like it's evolving so I'll keep it as it could have lots of potential. Maybe it will soon have all features from website and Apple version.,0,133eba99-2ae9-4023-a036-a7e6c005d577,Thanks Sandro. We have a lot of great features and improvements planned so stay tuned!
